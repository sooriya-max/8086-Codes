# Memory Copy Assembly Code

This assembly code performs block memory copies using the `REP MOVSB` instruction. It copies blocks of memory from one location to another within different segments.
## Code Explanation

The code is organized into segments and follows the structure below:

1. **Data Segment Initialization**
    - Initializes the data segment (`DS`) and extra segment (`ES`) with specific values.
    - Sets the source index (`SI`) and destination index (`DI`) for the first memory copy operation.
    - Clears the direction flag (`DF`) for an increment operation.
    - Copies a block of memory from DS:SI to ES:DI using `REP MOVSB`.

2. **Data Segment Update**
    - Updates the data segment (`DS`) to a new value.
    - Updates the extra segment (`ES`) to the original data segment value.
    - Sets new values for source index (`SI`) and destination index (`DI`).
    - Performs a second memory copy operation using `REP MOVSB`.

3. **Data Segment Update Again**
    - Updates the data segment (`DS`) to a new value.
    - Updates the extra segment (`ES`) to the previous data segment value.
    - Sets new values for source index (`SI`) and destination index (`DI`).
    - Performs a third memory copy operation using `REP MOVSB`.


Feel free to modify and experiment with the code according to your needs.
