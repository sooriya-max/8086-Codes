### Code Explanation

- **Data Segment Initialization:**
  - Initializes the Data Segment (DS) with 4000H.
  - Initializes the Source Index (SI) with 2000H.
  - Initializes the AL register to 0.
  - Sets the loop count to 000AH (10 iterations).

- **Comparison Loop (BACK):**
  - Compares the value in AL with the byte at the memory location pointed by SI.
  - Jumps to SKIP if no carry (AL >= [SI]).
  - Moves the byte at the memory location pointed by SI to AL.
  - Increments SI to move to the next byte.
  - Decrements CX (loop count).
  - Repeats the loop until CX is zero.

- **Storing the Result:**
  - Stores the final value of AL at the memory location pointed by SI.

- **Program Termination:**
  - Prepares for program termination using INT 21H with function 4CH.
